=head1 NAME

SIAM::Documentation::DriverSpec - SIAM driver specification


=head1 INTRODUCTION

A SIAM driver is what connects to the enterprise database and retrieves
objects and their attributes.

There is no base class for a driver, and the enterprises are free to implement
the drivers in in their preferred ways.

A driver is a Perl object which must provide a number of methods, as described
below. The validity of the driver is verified by
C<validate_driver()> method of C<SIAM::Object>


=head1 METHODS


=head2 fetch_attributes

 $status = $driver->fetch_attributes($attrs);

The argument is a hash reference that contains the SIAM::Object mandatory
attributes (C<object.id>, C<object.class>, and C<object.container_id>).

The driver should populate the provided hashref with the rest of the object's
attributes, based on its ID and class.

The method should return undef in case of failures, and true otherwise.
The failure details should be available through its C<error> and C<errmsg>
methods.



=head2 fetch_contained_object_ids

  $ids = $driver->fetch_contained_object_ids($id, $classname);

The method returns an arrayref containing IDs of contained objects of a
given class. The method must return an empty arrayref if there are no
contained objects.


=head2 errmsg

Returns the last error message in case of a failure.


=head2 connect

Connects the driver to its underlying databases. Returns true in case of
success.

=head2 disconect

Disconnects the driver from its underlying databases and frees its
internal memory. The driver should be able to connect() again.
